	  <ol>
		  <li>I started playing lacrosse in 5th grade I have played for 3 teams and have played 8 seasons I started playing midfield then I switched to defense in 7th grade and have played defense since then. 
			  Lacrosse holds a special place in my heart for a multitude of reasons. The excitement of the game is unparalleled, as it combines speed, strategy, and teamwork in a way that few sports can match. I love the adrenaline rush that comes from running down the field, stick in hand, ready to make a play. The camaraderie among teammates is another aspect I cherish; we support each other through every win and loss, forging lasting friendships along the way. Additionally, lacrosse has taught me valuable lessons in perseverance and discipline, pushing me to improve my skills and always strive for excellence. The thrill of scoring a goal or executing a perfect pass is incredibly rewarding, making each game a memorable experience that keeps me coming back for more. Overall, lacrosse is not just a sport for me; it's a passion that enriches my life.</li>
